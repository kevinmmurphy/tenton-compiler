# tenton-compiler
A compiler to create cross language source for classes that have common behaviors.

Greetings,
     I hate writing getters and setters for my classes. Additionally, it would be nice 
     to have the same classes in multiple languages (e.g. C++ and javascript) for inclusion in multiple 
     projects.
